# Coffee Shop Mock-Up Page - The Odin Project



The purpose of this project was to create all DOM elements using Javascript and using webpack to bundle files. 

I split CSS and JS into different files for each relevant page/element and challenged myself to curate the visual and responsive side of the site too following a process. 
I created a site map, wireframes for each page and planned it on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/K9aF9apKN1GzEXB3zvXQf3/Kiyomi-Caf%C3%A9?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=My24DAq900Bafvqc-1) before starting to code.

A mock-up webpage for a coffee shop created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The goal of this project was to develop a functional and visually appealing website while focusing on creating DOM elements dynamically with JavaScript and bundling code using Webpack.

### Features:
- Dynamic Content Creation: All DOM elements are created using JavaScript, allowing for a modular and scalable structure.
- Responsive Design: The page is designed to be responsive, ensuring a good user experience across different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
- Webpack Integration: Utilized Webpack to bundle all the project files, ensuring an optimized and efficient build process.
- Modular CSS and JS: Separated CSS and JS into different files for each relevant page/element, improving maintainability and organization.

### Process:
- Site Map and Wireframes: Before starting the development I created a site map and wireframes for each page using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/K9aF9apKN1GzEXB3zvXQf3/Kiyomi-Caf%C3%A9?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=My24DAq900Bafvqc-1) to ensure clear design and functionality.
- Visual and Responsive Design: Focused on making the website visually engaging and responsive, balancing both design aesthetics and user interaction.
- I plan on using this project to practice improving accessibility and responsiveness features in the future, integrating new technologies I have learned along the way to enhance the user experience.
