# Restaurant Page

A mock-up webpage for a coffee shop built with HTML, CSS and Javascript - [live preview](https://sarav929.github.io/restaurant-page/)

The purpose of this project was to create all DOM elements using Javascript and using webpack to bundle files. 

I split CSS and JS into different files for each relevant page/element and challenged myself to curate the visual and responsive side of the site too following a process. 
I created a site map, wireframes for each page and planned it on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/K9aF9apKN1GzEXB3zvXQf3/Kiyomi-Caf%C3%A9?node-id=0-1&m=dev&t=My24DAq900Bafvqc-1) before starting to code.
